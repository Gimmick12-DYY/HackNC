Rules for this coding project:  
1. Do NOT run `npm` commands except when installing new dependencies.  
2. Always check the latest official docs for Next.js, TailwindCSS, MUI, and OpenRouter before using features.  
3. Do NOT use Git commands. I’ll handle version control.  
4. Always fix linting errors before finalizing code.  
5. Maintain readability, minimal boilerplate, and modular code.  
6. Prefer functional React components with hooks.  
7. Keep integration simple — focus on correctness and clarity.  
8. Should you have any questions, consult back to vibe_coding_instructions/ITERATE.md
