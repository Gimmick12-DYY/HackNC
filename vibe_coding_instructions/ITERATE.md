Remember the project context:  
- Next.js + TailwindCSS + MUI + OpenRouter.  
- A blank canvas that allows node creation on click, each node expands into subnodes via LLM.  
- Retractable dashboard controls length, number, and temperature.  

When I ask for iteration:  
- Keep all existing functionality.  
- Modify or extend components step by step.  
- Preserve working code, avoid rewriting everything unless necessary.  
- If I say “add feature X,” integrate it into current architecture rather than replacing.  
- Always ensure lint passes.  
- Use latest package usage (consult docs).  

Your job is to remember the overall flow and improve incrementally.
