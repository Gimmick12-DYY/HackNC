I used this prompt to let the ChatGPT generating instructions for vibe coder:
You are an expert in system design and architecture. Now I want to vibe code a project using Next.js, MUI, openrouter, and tailwind css that achieves the following: the main page of the website is a balnk sheet, where when user click on anywhere inside the container, a new node (obsidian like) will be created. Then, user are allowed to enter anything (any inspiration inside the node), and immediately after the node is created, several subnodes (which connect to the node) will be created and contains the exploration of the idea: for example, if i enter the node dog, it comes up with 3 nodes of breed, behavior, intelligence etc. This subnodal generation will be achieved through LLM communication: I will write a prompt to the LLM and let the LLM generate few inspirational idea based on the node just created. Then, user can further click on any code to further exploration the inspiration. Note that there are parameters can be controlled in a retractble dashboard: length of phrases per node, number of node per time, divergeness (temperature). I have already init the Next.js project, I want you to write a few prompts for the codex/ 1. a starter prompt for writing the components. 2. a iteration prompt in case further iteration is needed in hte vibe coding, i.e. it lets the coder agent to remeber what to do. 3. a rule prompt where it contains 1. no need to run npm commands except for intalling, 2. always consult online for latest usage of package, 3. do not use any of the git, 4. always fix the lint error. Give me these three prompt that I can download directly, so that it won't be messed up through the rendering of chatgpt.
